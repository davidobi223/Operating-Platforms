# Operating-Platforms

This software design was for a client called "The Gaming Room". I was assigned with helping the client in making a gaming application that can be played on mulitple platforms and servers. I beleive I did well with creating the document and I don't think there is one thing I can pick out that I did better than the other with the creation of this software design. Learning about different platforms such as Linux, Windows and Mac gave me a better insight on which platform/s I would choose to write code for in the long run. Interpeting the user's needs wasn't too bad for me I found them to be straight forward and processed it by going step by step with each assignment I was given. Lastly, when considering the users needs when designing you should always find the best path for yourself on how you can accommodate their needs as quick and efficiently as possible with the utmost quality.
